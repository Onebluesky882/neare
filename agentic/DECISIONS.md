# DECISIONS.md

## Purpose
Record architectural decisions that all agents must follow. DECISIONS.md is authoritative — workers may not deviate without Conductor approval.

## Decision: Version Policy

**Date:** 2026-06-16
**Status:** ACCEPTED

**Context:**
Workers default to package versions from training data, which are outdated. Example: choosing Vite v4 when current stable is v8. This causes security exposure and missing features.

**Decision:**
All packages must use the latest stable version at time of installation unless a version is explicitly pinned below in "Pinned Versions". Workers must verify current version at runtime before installing — training-data version numbers are not authoritative.

Mandatory check before install:
```bash
npm info <package> version        # Node
pip index versions <package>      # Python
cargo search <package>            # Rust
```

Bootstrap scaffolds must use `@latest`:
```bash
npm create vite@latest
npx create-next-app@latest
npx create-expo-app@latest
```

See AGENT_RULES.md → Version Policy for enforcement rules and violation consequences.

**Consequences:**
* Workers must run the version check and include verified version in gate-out `dependencies_added`
* Claiming "latest" without the check command output = Status: FAIL
* If a specific version is required, Dev or Conductor must pin it in "Pinned Versions" below

## Pinned Versions

**Authority: Dev only.** Only Dev may add, change, or remove entries here. Conductor and Workers may NOT modify this table. Any change must be logged in DEV_LOG.md.

When a package appears in this table, workers must use the exact version specified — the `@latest` rule does NOT apply. Workers may not upgrade or downgrade without Dev approval.

Format:

| Package | Pinned Version | Reason | Pinned By | Date |
|---------|---------------|--------|-----------|------|
| example: react | 18.3.1 | stability — v19 breaking changes not yet assessed | Dev | 2026-06-16 |

Pinned Versions:

| Package | Pinned Version | Reason | Pinned By | Date |
|---------|---------------|--------|-----------|------|
| (none) | — | all packages use @latest | — | — |

## Decision: Agent Orchestration Patterns

**Date:** 2026-06-23
**Status:** ACCEPTED

**Context:**
The system needs to support four orchestration modes: single agent (current), supervisor routing, parallel fan-out, and sequential safe mode. Without a clear decision on which to use when, workers will either over-engineer simple tasks or choose parallel execution when tasks have hidden dependencies — causing race conditions or data corruption.

**Decision:**
Four patterns are supported, governed by a strict decision flowchart (see AGENT_RULES.md Orchestration Rule). Sequential is the default safe fallback. Parallel is opt-in and only allowed when all tasks are provably independent.

**Technical implementation in this stack (Anthropic Managed Agents):**

| Pattern | Managed Agents feature | When |
|---|---|---|
| Single | `sessions.create` + single agent | Default |
| Supervisor | `multiagent: {type: "coordinator"}` + sub-agents roster | Unknown task type at request time |
| Parallel fan-out | Coordinator dispatches to multiple sub-agents simultaneously; waits for all `thread_status_idle` | Tasks provably independent |
| Sequential | Coordinator dispatches one sub-agent, waits for `thread_status_idle`, then next | Tasks have any dependency |

**Retry + Fallback rules:**

- If a sub-agent fails (`session.status_terminated` or `session.error`): retry once with the same agent
- If retry also fails: fall back to Sequential Pattern — the coordinator handles the failed task itself using single-agent mode
- Never silently discard a failed task — always surface the error to the user
- Fallback model for Anthropic refusals: `claude-opus-4-8` (already wired in stage-12 via `fallbacks` param)

**Safe mode enforcement:**

Before dispatching parallel, the coordinator must check:
1. Do any tasks write to the same file path?
2. Does any task's output become another task's input?
3. Do any tasks modify the same D1 row?

If any check is true → block parallel, use sequential automatically.

**Consequences:**
- Orchestration pattern must be documented in every task file that uses multi-agent
- Workers must not choose Parallel unless they have verified all tasks are independent
- Sequential is always valid — workers must never choose Parallel to "look better"
- Retry + fallback logic must be implemented in `agent.handler.ts` for any multi-agent stage

## Decision: Anthropic Managed Agents for Web-Based Code Editing

**Date:** 2026-06-23
**Status:** ACCEPTED

**Context:**
Non-technical clients (business owners with no VSCode, no terminal) need to request code changes to their project via a web UI. A web interface backed by Claude must be able to read and modify their codebase directly without requiring the client to touch code or a terminal.

**Decision:**
Use **Anthropic Managed Agents** (`/v1/agents`, `/v1/sessions`) with a `github_repository` resource. Client's GitHub PAT is stored in an **Anthropic Vault** (never in the database as plaintext). Each chat session mounts the client's repo at `/workspace`. Claude uses file tools to modify files, then commits and pushes. All communication is HTTP — compatible with Cloudflare Workers.

**Anthropic resource model:**
- One shared Agent → `ANTHROPIC_AGENT_ID` secret (created once via setup script)
- One shared Environment → `ANTHROPIC_ENV_ID` secret (created once via setup script)
- Per-user Vault → `vault_id` stored in database
- Per-conversation Session → `session_id` stored in database

**Consequences:**
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk` required in the API app
- Cloudflare secrets required: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AGENT_ID`, `ANTHROPIC_ENV_ID`
- GitHub PAT stored in Anthropic Vault only — never logged, never database plaintext
